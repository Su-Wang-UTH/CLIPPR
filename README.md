# CLIPPR
**CLIPPR** is an algorithm that combines the top-performing **single-cell** models with RNA-inferred **copy number variation (CNV)** signals and the initial **bulk** model to create a **meta-model**, which exhibits the strongest performance in meningioma classification. It shows superior overall accuracy and resolved benign-malignant confusion. The generalizability of CLIPPR has been validated using our single-cell and bulk glioma data. CLIPPR synergizes the resolution of single-cell data with the depth of bulk sequencing and enables improved cancer sub-group diagnoses and insights into their biology.
